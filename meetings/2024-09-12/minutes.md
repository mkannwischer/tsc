## Minutes/actions from previous meeting

No additional notes

### Updates from related communities

#### PQCA

* PQC/5G proposal - will be presenting to board. Feedback for that team from some industry experts involved in GSMA, 3GPP etc.
* Tooling working group - voting underway. Initial project is sonarqube plugin
* Following up on open issues around project lifecycle document

#### OQS

* Finalizing next release of liboqs - 0.11, including ML-KEM (from PQCrystals - in future hope to get from pqcp)
* Release candidate expected by end of week
* Also includes libjade versino of Kyber (with Tiago's help especially around packaging/licensing)
* Additional NISTsignature on-ramp algorithms
* ML-DSA not in this release (will be from PQCrystals, again hope to see this from pqcp)

### Review of subprojects

### mlkem-c-aarch64

* Hanno working with Ry on getting the ec2 benchmarking setup - now working. Can select/run benchmarks/tests & in CI regularly running on Graviton 2 (free) + 3 (paid). Fiddly but flexible/easy to use.
* NTT Assembly - starting with clean, then will use super optimized version.
* Discussion on benchmarking framework and results - useful for other projects. See workflow files in github
* Douglas will mention to spencer / pravek who have been looking at overhauling existing system.
  * [Example charts](https://pq-code-package.github.io/mlkem-c-aarch64/dev/bench/)

### mlkem-c-libjade

* Had been an ambitious plan to try and get initial version in by the summer holidays
* now expecting to have final implementation of super optimized avx mlkem ready in next few months.
* Proof not yet complete - like this completed before pushing.

### mlkem-c-generic

* PR and issues open for review
* Will reach out to Basil for feedback & then Peter once initial load done.
* Need to get a point of being a viable upstream for liboqs (and meet their expectations around testing etc.)
* Welcome comments, feedback, and participation ie for maintainers. Peter Schwabe has offered advice and help
* Code is reference only, from *standard* branch. Not includin AVX
* Tiago pointed out that the standards branch is now merged into PQCrystals main

#### Open TSC issues

* Issues open on ML-DSA and some other algorithms - if anyone is having discussions with the implementors of these and want to open up discussion on pqcp that would be helpful.
  * Nigel is asking IBM colleagues involved in ML-DSA
* Norman pointed out there's some debate over stateful signatures and whether it belongs in a library when it's mostly used in HSMs (NIST has some guidance)
* Manuel points out that stateful hash based signatures will be coming into libjade. Will reach out to Andreas HÃ¼lsing. State needs to be kept tamper proof, but may be variety of options like usb keys.
* Ongoing discussion on random bytes - Tiago thinks could be somewhat out of scope, need to be careful - though ok for testing. Look for thoughts from Matthias when back. Also we need to agree on API - jasmine implementation requires specific function to be defined. Can then document.
