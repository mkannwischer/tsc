2025-02-13 : TSC Minutes
Welcome
Nigel welcomed everyone to the meeting and noted that the minutes from the previous meeting had been approved with one minor correction.    

Membership changes
Douglas Stebila
Douglas Stebila has resigned from the Technical Steering Committee (TSC).    

Jake Massimo
The MLDSA-Native project has been welcomed as a sub-project.  A proposal has been made to add Jake Massimo (@jakemas) to the TSC as a voting member.  An offline vote will be held.    

New meeting time proposal
A proposal was made to update the meeting times to better accommodate participants in the US.  The current proposal is to split the meeting into two:   

Europe/Asia meeting at 10:00 CET
9:00 UK, 17:00 Taiwan
Europe/USA meeting at 17:00 CET
8:00 US West Coast, 10:00 Toronto, 11:00 US East Coast
The meetings will continue to be scheduled for 30 minutes and follow daylight savings time.  They will continue to be held on Thursdays, two weeks between each meeting, so four weeks per slot.

OQS
Review status of sub projects
MLDSA-Native
The repository has been created, and a couple of pull requests have been opened.    
The reference implementation has been added, along with basic tests.    
License headers and formatting have been added.    
Many things can be taken over from ML-KEM-Native.    
The goal is to have CVMX proofs for all the C code and some other formal verification for the Assembly.    
It is hard to tell how long this will take to get into shape.    
ML-KEM-Libjade
No updates.

ML-KEM-Rust-Libcrux
No updates.

ML-KEM-Native
API changes are being discussed.    
The API will be implemented in MLK-Native.    
The NIST discussions did not go any further.    
The API will be implemented in a backward, compatible way.    
Additional functions will be added.    
The NIST issue will be closed.    
The AWS-LC integration is in progress.    
A draft pull request has been opened.    
The pull request has not been rejected or merged yet.    
Discussion (if not covered previously)
The OpenSSL CLA issue was discussed.    
The issue is whether to get the contributors to ML-KEM-Native to sign the CLA.    
This means not just the current contributors but also the previous contributors to the reference implementation.    
The feedback from the PQCrystals team was positive, but not everyone has responded yet.    
There are about eight people on the reference implementation.    
It is not very likely that OpenSSL will use the PQCP algorithm.    
The PQCP TSC needs to decide whether it is worth the time to get the CLA signed.    
The issue will be closed if it is not going anywhere.    
The PQCrystals team will be double-checked.    
If they have not signed the CLA, then the issue will be closed.    
The backlog of issues was briefly discussed.    
It was suggested that the backlog be reviewed at a future meeting.    
Any other business
No other business was discussed.

Action items
New
An offline vote will be held on whether to add Jake Massimo (@jakemas) to the TSC as a voting member.    
The issue on the new meeting times will be annotated.    
The PQCA calendar invites will be updated.    
The minutes will be updated to include the links to the PQCA blog posts.    
A new issue will be created to discuss whether PQCP should make its own ML-KEM provider.    
The NIST issue will be closed.    
The OpenSSL CLA issue will be closed if the PQCrystals team has not signed the CLA.    
The backlog of issues will be reviewed at a future meeting.
